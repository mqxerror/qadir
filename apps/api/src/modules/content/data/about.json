  "origin": {
    "title": "Our Origin",
    "body": "QADIR was born in Montreal — a city that understands the power of measured expression. In a market saturated with mass-produced fragrances and loud marketing, we chose a different path: restraint, precision, and the confidence to let quality speak without amplification.\n\nThe name QADIR (قدير) means 'capable' and 'powerful' in Arabic — not the power of volume, but the power of mastery. Every decision in our house reflects this principle."

  "founder": {
    "title": "The Founder",
    "body": "Our founder's journey began with the scent of oud in family gatherings — raw, uncompromising, impossibly rich. Years later, surrounded by Montreal's minimalist design culture, a question formed: what happens when you apply restraint to one of the world's most complex fragrance traditions?\n\nThe answer is QADIR. Four Signature Blends that honour oud tradition while speaking the language of modern luxury."

  "philosophy": {
    "title": "Our Philosophy",
    "body": "Luxury is not decoration. It is the confidence to present less, knowing that what remains is exceptional. Our fragrances are conceived as a collection — not individual products competing for attention, but four voices in deliberate conversation.\n\nASL speaks authority. NOOR illuminates. HAYBA commands presence. MIQDAR provides depth. Together, they represent a complete olfactive philosophy."
