The result is a fragrance house that treats scent as architecture — where every note is placed with deliberate intent, and silence between notes matters as much as the notes themselves."

Each blend carries a name rooted in Arabic, a role within the collection, and an olfactive profile designed to evolve on skin over hours. We do not chase trends. We craft permanence."
